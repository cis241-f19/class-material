## Minilab 11

This minilab will help you get some experience using pointers.

1. Write a function that accepts a pointer and the size
   of the array and computes the cumulative sums (storing
   the resulting sums in a newly created array).  Aka,
   if my array is [1,4,3], the cumulative sums would be
   [1,5,8].  Return the pointer to the array.
2. Allocate enough memory for 12 integers on the heap.
3. Use a for loop and pointer arithmetic to fill the it
   with numbers from 0 to 11.
4. Call your function with the dynamically allocated array.
5. Use a for loop to print out the resulting sum.

Note:  since the goal of this is to practice with pointers,
I'd recommend trying this only using pointer arithmetic
style (and never using the bracket notation) -- just to
get comfortable with it.
