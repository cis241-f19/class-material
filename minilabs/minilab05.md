1. Create your own repository on your local machine
2. Create a file with 10 lines of text (the text can
   be anything).
3. Add, and commit the file created in step 3
4. Create and switch to a new branch (any name is fine)
5. Modify lines 1, 2, 8, and 9 of the file in the new branch
   (the actual modification doesn't matter, just change the text
   on those lines)
6. Add and commit the changed file
7. Switch back to master branch
8. Modify lines 1 and 2 of the file.
9. Add and commit the modified file.
10. Merge the branch you made back into master.
11. You should get a merge conflict which you'll need to resolve
    by manually editing the file with the conflict or using
    a mergetool such as `meld`.  You can keep whatever lines you
    choose
12. Don't forget to add and commit to finish the merge.
