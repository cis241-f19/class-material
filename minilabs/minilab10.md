This example will help you become familiar with C.  This example will
use a simple cipher to encode text.

1. Create a character array initialized to a string of your choice.
2. Choose an integer value between [1,5].
3. For each character in your string:
    * Add (or subtract -- your choice, but choose the same one or choose
      a pattern of how you add/subtract) the integer chosen from ascii
      value for the character
    * Print out the resulting character after modifying the ascii value.

The resulting string is your encoded string.  Because you used a systematic
method to encode it, you could decode it as well.
