Hello!
This is a text file for playing with vim.
It just has a few lines of text that don't mean anything.
whatever, meaning is overrated anyways.
Another sentence. This line should be deleted.
Delete all the this : hello hello hello goodbye
Delete all everything after the colon:  hello how r u? goodbye

Goodbye!
