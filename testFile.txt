Hello!
This is a text file for playing with vim.
It just has a few lines of text that don't mean anything.
But whatever, meaning is overrated anyways.
This line should be deleted.
Delete all the hellos on this line:  hello hello hello goodbye
Delet all everything after the colon:  hello how r u? goodbye

Goodbye!
